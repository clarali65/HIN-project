# HIN-project
Here I store some code and files I write when I'm doing my HIN project.
Fristly,I read some paper about several models to process HIN information like nodes and edges,including ASPEM,meta-path2vec after I finish the basic paper reading in word2vec and other paper refers to heterogeneous information network such as node2vec,random walk and etc.
And my project stepped into a new stage that I started to write some codes.My first coding in this project is to change the HIN files into the standard HIN file format:attribute_node center_node weight edge_type,where edge_type I use the combination of attribute node and center node.Note that center node should at the second place.
